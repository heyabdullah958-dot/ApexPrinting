Initial tracking of project changes.

### Vibe Coder Workflow Completion (Phase 4 & 5)
- **Phase 4**: Finalized order confirmation emails via `email.js`. Ensured `paymentMethod` is extracted from the `multipart/form-data` during quote/contact submission and appropriately sent to the store owner. Removed undefined prices in quotes since the Stripe and quote pricing engine was decoupled.
- **Phase 5**: Adjusted splash screen logic in `index.html`, `contact.html`, and `services.html` to leverage `sessionStorage`. The splash animation will only trigger on the first page load per session to improve navigation performance.
